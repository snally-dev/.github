# 🐉 Snally

**Where data shapeshifts and experiments escape the lab.**

Snally is a playground for creative development, home to data-driven prototypes, visual experiments, and small tools born from curiosity. Projects explore the space where **JavaScript, Python, and design collide**, blending folklore, data, and storytelling.

### ✨ Ethos
Code should be playful.  
Data should tell stories.  
Not every experiment needs to behave.

**Built for curiosity.**
